# Breaking project - Spotify

During my master degree I does not have enough time to keep working as a frontend-developer. And as it should be expected, I started to lose my skill. So I decided to work with a Spotify full function clone on Next.js 12.

# IMPORTANT INFO

I started this project with simple Spotify API, but then I found out that not all functionality is avaidable with this method. It is very limited version of what I wanted. So I will complete this version and then probably redo this with SDK in new branch. And now, for political reasons, I can't renew my Spotify subscription (required for SDK). Thus, the project stops until the situation is resolved.
